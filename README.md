# Encryption

ASSIGNMENT FOR BRAINSTATION

Using Wireshark on my Kali Linux virtual machine, I captures the TLS handshake for an HTTPS connection to https://www.google.com. I ensured that I filtered my capture to focus specifically on the handshake process.

Utilizing screenshots, I provided the following information:

The timestamp and details of the ClientHello, ServerHello, and the Key Exchange messages exchanged during the TLS handshake.
Explained the purpose and significance of each message in the TLS handshake process.
Identified the source and destination IP addresses and port numbers for each packet in the handshake.
Confirmed packets are encrypted after the handshake
